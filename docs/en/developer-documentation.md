## Customising the output columns

In order to customise the columns included in a report you can build a custom extension and apply it to the
SitewideContentReport as necessary.

The built in extensions, for instance, each add custom columns extracted from other modules, and can
be used as a base for developing further extensions:

 - `SitewideContentReview` - Integrates with the [content review](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-contentreview) module.
 - `SitewideContentSubsites` - Integrates with the [subsites](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-subsites) module.
 - `SitewideContentTaxonomy` - Integrates with the [taxonomy](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-taxonomy) module.

For instance, in order to add a new Page field to the report you could add an extension similar to the below:


```php

    use SilverStripe\Core\Extension;
    use SilverStripe\SiteWideContentReport\SiteWideContentReport;

	class MyReportExtension extends Extension {
		public function updateColumns($itemType, &$columns) {
			if(itemType !== 'Pages') {
				return;
			}
			$columns["Price"] = array(
				"title" => _t(SitewideContentReport::class . ".Subsite", "Subsite"),
				"formatting" => function ($value, $item) use ($mainSiteLabel) {
					return number_format($value, 2, '.', ',');
				},
			);
		}
	}
```

The $columns array can have any number of items added, where the key of the array represents the
field name to be included.

Each item can be either a literal string (which will be used as the title), or an array that may contain
the following key => value pairs:

 * `title`: The title to use for the column header
 * `format`: A method callback which will take the raw value and original object, and return a formatted
    string.
 * `datasource`: If the value for this column isn't a direct field on the original object, a custom callback
   can be set here. Unlike `format` this callback will only take a single parameter, the original object.
 * `printonly`: Set to true if this column is only visible on the print or export-to-csv views.
 * `casting`: Specify a field type (e.g. `Text` or `Int`) in order to assist with field casting. This is not
    necessary if `formatting` is used.
